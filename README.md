## About

Langauto is a **web application for practising grammar and vocabulary** in multiple languages.
Originally created as a study tool for Latin, it has since been expanded to support multiple languages, such as **English, Portuguese German, Dutch, and Scottish Gaelic** (not all these languages are publicly available at the moment).

The app is designed for learners who want to practise grammar structures and expand their vocabulary through **interactive exercises**, accessible anytime on desktop or mobile. Unlike AI-generated content, the exercises are based on carefully pre-defined structures and vocabulary aligned with the CEFR levels for each language.
